After doing the instructions in the forkMe file on the readme.md page, we should check the status of the files on GitHub.

But before we do that, we should make sure we are all pushing to the same repo, like Saidat's.  Before we begin work in Saidat's repo, let's play with this repo!

Change or add any lines of this document after line 6 and push them back to the repo using the method shown in the previous video tutorial or the tutorial from kbroman.
