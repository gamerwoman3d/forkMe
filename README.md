# forkMe

Git workflow for Death or Cake team  

Step 1) Check out this video!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE  

To practice, we are going to clone THIS file!
In your command line, go to the directory on your computer where you want to save the Death or Cake files. This will be your local computer's folder where you will do and save your work.  

Directories are changed with the command 'cd' for change directory.  In my case example, my files will be saved on my local computer in C:/Users/MyProfile/Documents.
Once you navigate to your directory by typing 'cd ..' to go up to the C: directory and then typing 'cd /Users/MyProfile/Documents/ you will want to clone this file.

Once you are in your preferred directory on the command line, it's time to save a copy of this file into that directory!  That can be done with the 'git clone' command, and the clone URL of the repository or code file in question.

"How do I find my GitHub clone URL?"

On the GitHub website, click on your repository of interest.
Locate the green button named Code and click on it. The GitHub URL will appear.
Copy the GitHub URL.
Open a Git client such as the BASH shell or GitHub Desktop on your local machine.
Use the GitHub URL to clone the remote repo.

For this repo, that URL will be https://github.com/gamerwoman3d/forkMe.git !

The entire clone command would look like the following:
git clone https://github.com/gamerwoman3d/forkMe.git

That will take the forkMe repository and copy all of the files on it to your computer in the directory you are in.
If you use the comand 'ls' for list you will see a list of files in the directory.  

You can open the files in VSCode or in your code editor.  

You can then change the code, and save the changes on your local computer!  Next we will do push, pull, commit, in order to change these files and push them to Saidat's repository!
